        # To assign specific IP addresses to specific

        # configuration files (see man page for more info).

        # EXAMPLE: Suppose the client
        # having the certificate common name "Thelonious"
        # also has a small subnet behind his connecting
        # machine, such as 192.168.40.128/255.255.255.248.
        # First, uncomment out these lines:
#       client_config_dir /etc/openvpn/ccd
#       route "192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248"
        # Then create a file ccd/Thelonious with this line:
        #   iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
        # This will allow Thelonious' private subnet to
        # access the VPN.  This example will only work
        # if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are
        # using "dev tun" and "server" directives.

        # EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to give
        # Thelonious a fixed VPN IP address of 10.9.0.1.
        # First uncomment out these lines:
#       client_config_dir /etc/openvpn/ccd
#       route "10.9.0.0 255.255.255.252"
#       route "192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0"
        # Then add this line to ccd/Thelonious:
        #   ifconfig-push "10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2"

        # Suppose that you want to enable different
        # firewall access policies for different groups
        # of clients.  There are two methods:
        # (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each
        #     group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface
        #     for each group/daemon appropriately.
        # (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically
        #     modify the firewall in response to access
        #     from different clients.  See man
        #     page for more info on learn-address script.

        # (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT
        # the TUN/TAP interface to the internet in
        # order for this to work properly).
        # CAVEAT: May break client's network config if
        # client's local DHCP server packets get routed
        # through the tunnel.  Solution: make sure
        # client's local DHCP server is reachable via
        # a more specific route than the default route
        # of 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0.
